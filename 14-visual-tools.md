# 14 - Visual tools

So far, you've used the command line to interact with git. While this is a good way to get detailed information about what's happening, it can be a bit overwhelming. There are several visual tools that can help you visualize what's happening with your repository. Here are a few examples:
1. GitHub Desktop
2. SourceTree
3. The built-in git functionality in Visual Studio Code

## GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a GUI for git that is available for Windows and MacOS. It is a good tool for beginners who are not yet comfortable with the command line. You can download it [here](https://desktop.github.com/).

## SourceTree

SourceTree is a free GUI for git that is available for Windows and MacOS. It is a bit more advanced than GitHub Desktop, but it is still easy to use. You can download it [here](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).

## Visual Studio Code

If you use Visual Studio Code, you can use the built-in git functionality. This is a good option if you are already familiar with Visual Studio Code. You can find more information [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol).
