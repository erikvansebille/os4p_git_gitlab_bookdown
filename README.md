# Git & GitLab Tutorial eBook for Open Science for Physicists


This is a tutorial on git & GitLab for the course [Open Science for Physicists](https://osiris-student.uu.nl/onderwijscatalogus/extern/cursus?cursuscode=NS-PH500M&taal=en&collegejaar=huidig) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/department-of-physics/education/masters-programmes).

This tutorial is forked and slightly adapted from the tutorial on git & GitHub for scientists without formal programming background: https://gitbookdown.dallasdatascience.com.


Git for version control      |  GitLab for collaboration

## Why is git important for physicists?

Git facilitates (1) **documentation**, and (2) **sharing/collaborating**. Both of these are important in physics.

* **I. Version-control for code = the lab notebook of experiments. We need documentation for all our processes:**
  + Scenario A: Things were working, now they are not!
  + Scenario B: Why were changes made?
  + Scenario C: We made changes a long time ago…

* **II. Git and Remote Hosts (e.g., GitLab or GitHub) makes sharing/collaborating easier**
  + Sharing code made easy
  + Facilitates new collaboration
  + Encourages open source and open science
